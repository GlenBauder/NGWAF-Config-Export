This script exports the corp and site rule config in json format.

It requires the dstoken and _DUO_APER_LOCAL_ cookies for authentication so you don't need an API key for the specific corp.  These can be obtained but using developer mode in your browser and checking the application tab (chrome), while logged in to salt.

script will create a directory and idividual files in that directory for the corp and each site within that corp.
